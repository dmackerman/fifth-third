53HolidayPayback@gmail.com during an Entry Period. All entries must be written in English, and must not, as
determined in Sponsor’s sole discretion, contain language that is unlawful, which infringes upon another’s rights, or

entrants may enter each Sweepstakes each Entry Period. Entries submitted in excess of the stated limitation will
be void. Entries will be made by the authorized account holder of the Twitter username or email account submitted
